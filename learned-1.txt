hello world

1) cl: install django and djangoframework
2) cl: django-admin startproject <project name> in this case, 
3) cl: cd into music_controller folder
4) cl: django-admin startapp api
#apps are the apps that the project can use, in this case, and api
5) add app ApiConfig to project settings.py
    'api.apps.ApiConfig',  <- "api" name is same name from step 4
    'rest_framework'
# views are what functions get used
6)open api/views.py, add function that returns something on httrequest (make sure to import HttpResponse from django.http)
    #def main(request):
        #return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello</h1>")
#url endpoints get handled by...urls.py
7) cl: touch api/urls.py
8) make music_controller/urls.py point to api/urls.py
    #urlpatterns = [
        path('', include('api.urls'))   <--- if blank path, look up in api.urls
    ]
9) make api/urs.py execute a function at this endpoints
    urlpatterns = [
        path('home', main)    <---- if path ends in 'home', launch main form step 6
    ]
10) 'compile' - 
    cl: python \manage.py makemigrations
    cl: python \manage.py migrate

11) run server
    cl: python \manage.py runserver
    #server automatically updates as you update filesizeformat

How it works!:
1)url get parsed in music_controller.urls.py (the main urls.py), and told what to do
    -in this case, if the path is blank, loop up everything after "" in api.urls
    -ex: path('home/', ('api.urls')) - if path had "home/" after base url (https://127.0.0.1:8000/home/) - look up everything after 'home/' in api.urls
2)second part of url gets looked up in api.urls (the app urls.py), and told what to do there
    -in this case, ../home/hi, looks up "hi" in api.urls, which executes the function main from 'api.views' 
3)main is executed, which returns "Hello, World" on the http request
