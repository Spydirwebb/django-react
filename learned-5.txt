#handling post requests
#creating a room from a post request
1)api/serializers
    create a serializer that handles the post request
    post request will have the payload (eg. votes to skip, guests can pause)
    ##Room serializer serializes room data, CreateRoomSerializer serializes the data to create a room
    ##good idea to have a serializer for all requests, like get or post serializers
    ##serialize = does it match the model?
    class CreateRoomSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Room
            fields = ('guest_can_pause', 'votes_to_skip')
